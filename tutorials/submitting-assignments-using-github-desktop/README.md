# Submitting Assignments Using GitHub Desktop

Burden: *~30 minutes*

Follow every step of these instructions carefully and avoid submitting your assignment in haste or with distractions around you, as these will no doubt hinder your ability to submit successfully.

**Note**: Before proceeding, make sure you’re using the latest stable release of GitHub Desktop. As of this writing, version 223, Hasty Things Done Hastily, is the latest. **Do not use the beta version**. If you need to download GitHub Desktop, go [here](https://desktop.github.com) and scroll all the way to the bottom of the page for the latest stable version.

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/login) and visit the assignment’s repository, or repo, page. For this example, I’ll use a dummy, or slug, repo called `assignment-1`, `https://github.com/code-warrior/assignment-1`.

2. Fork the `assignment-1` repo by clicking the word `fork` in the upper right hand corner.

4. Once the fork is done, you’ll be taken to the fork’s page in your account. Note the URL and the info in the top left corner to verify that you now have a fork of your own:

5. Now copy, or clone, the repo to your computer by (1) clicking the green `Clone or download` button, then (2) clicking `Open in Desktop`, which will launch the GitHub Desktop client.

6. In the GitHub Desktop client, leave the entry for `Clone As:` alone, then choose where you want to save the fork. (I’m saving in a folder called `GitHub`.) Click `Clone` in the lower right corner.

7. Every student in any assignment repository has their own branch, formatted as `FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME--GITHUB-USERNAME`. Click `master` in the GitHub Desktop client, at the top, along the left, then choose your branch.

8. Along the left column, under **GitHub**, you should see your cloned repository. Context click it and choose `Open in Finder` or `Open in Explorer` if you’re using Windows.

10. Return to the `GitHub Desktop` client. Your changes should appear as uncommitted changes next to `History`. In the screenshot below, for example, I added `IMG_0456.jpg` and made a change to `index.html`. Both are considered `2 Uncommitted Changes`.

11. Commit your changes by (1) creating a commit message, (2) clicking the `Commit to BRANCH_NAME` button, and (3) clicking `Sync`. For example, I’m committing the addition of a picture of a llama.
