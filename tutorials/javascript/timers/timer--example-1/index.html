   <h1>JavaScript Examples | Timer (Example 1)</h1>
   <p>The following paragraph will expand, based on a class that is added then removed via two timers. The first timer waits a half a second to add a class, triggering the transition; the second waits three seconds to transition back by removing the class added by the first timer.</div>
   <p>I expand. Just wait a moment.</p>
